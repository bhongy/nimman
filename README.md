# nimman (work in progress)
A(nother prototype) Server-side Render Web Server Framework of mine.

Written for Node 8 or higher.

Related prototype: https://github.com/bhongy/kaidown/tree/experiment-001/experiments/001


## To Develop

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn tsc
$ node example/startServer
```


## Principles

It is designed for server-side rendered, multi-pages, large-scale web applications.


## DevServer Features

- [X] Holds the request until the compilation is completed
- [ ] Lazy Compilation, always
  - [ ] Recompile only changed files
- [ ] Dynamic Entry. Compile only the subtree related to the entry point.
- [ ] File-based routing
- [ ] Webpack entries generated by file-based routing
- [ ] Hot Reloading Client
- [ ] Hot Reloading Server


## Thoughts

- "render" layer should be network (req, res) ignorant. Merely taking what it should render, renders it, and return the string result.

- onDemandPageHandler: model all the states that it'll be in "building", "page not found" etc. early in the function then delegate to different strategies/handlers

- example app: an email client like gmail
